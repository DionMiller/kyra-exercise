# Hi,
# Thank your for viewing my exercise,

To start the project please install npm packages in both folders,\
then run the node.js app with: 

`nodemon api.js`

Then run the react app found in the frontend folder with npm start.

`npm start`

Thanks again for considering me for this opportunity!

Dion
