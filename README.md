# Hi,
# Thank your for viewing my exercise,

To start the project please install the npm packages in both folders,\
Please create an .env file in the backend with the following variables:

PORT=4000\
FSQ_API_KEY={API_KEY}
URL='https://api.foursquare.com/v3/places/search?query=coffee'\

Then run the node.js app with the following
`nodemon api.js`

Then run the react app found in the frontend folder with npm start.

`npm start`

Thanks again for considering me for this opportunity!

Dion
